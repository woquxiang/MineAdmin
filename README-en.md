## Projects Description

PHP has a lot of good backend management system, but Swoole based backend management system did not find suitable for my own.
So it developed a set of background management system. The system can be used for website management background , CMS, CRM, OA, ERP and so on.

Background system based on Hyperf framework development. Enterprise-level architecture layered to easily support startups and personal pre-development use , using a small amount of server resources comparable to the performance of static language .
Front-end use of Vue3 + Vite4 + Pinia + Arco, one end of the adaptation of PC, mobile, tablet!

If you think it's not bad, please point a ⭐star support it, it will be the biggest support and encouragement to me!
